# React Minting Website

## About the Project
This project introduced and showcased how to integrate smart contracts into an frontend application. This was done through constructing an NFT minting website, which enabled users to mint NFTs by firstly connecting their metamask wallet to the application and signing the transcation for minting the nfts.

Through completing this project, I was able to learn the various frameworks and technologies that are commonly used in creating decentralized applications (Daaps), which I hope can be applied to other personal projects.

The Project is following EdRoth's tutorial:

### Application Technologies
Technologies used:
- Solidity - Used for developing the smart contracts
- Hardhat - Ethereum development environment used for compiling and deploying the contracts
- Ethers.JS - JS Library used for interacting with Ethereum Blockchain
- React - For the frontend UI
- Alchemy - Platform used for connecting the application to the Blockchain
- Chakra - UI library


## How to use
1) Clone the repo
2) Install packages by running `npm install`
3) Create an env file and populate it with your deployed contract address, etherscan key, wallet provider private key and corresponding Alchemy application keys
4) Run the application by running `npm run start`
